# Art Bay Frontend

This is a Next.js 15 storefront for the Art Bay marketplace API (`https://art-bay-e7451b528caa.herokuapp.com/`). It supports JWT and DRF Token auth flows, Stripe checkout, Mongo-backed products, and user profile/addresses/orders.

## Environment

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or `.env.local`) and fill in the values you receive from Stripe, MongoDB Atlas, Google, etc.
- Keep `.env` untracked—real credentials must come from your local developer machine or from Netlify environment variables.
- Keys starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are expected to be published to the browser; other keys must remain server-only.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://art-bay-e7451b528caa.herokuapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
```

Notes:
- The frontend appends `/api/v1` automatically to `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`.
- JWT endpoints are used when available; it falls back to DRF Token endpoints.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` start dev server
- `npm run build` build
- `npm start` serve production

## Key Routes

- `/products` product listing with search and category filter
- `/products/[productId]` product details
- `/cart` local cart with server-backed product details
- `/checkout` Stripe card element + order creation (`POST /orders/`)
- `/auth/login`, `/auth/register` credential forms (also accessible via header modal)
- `/profile` view/update profile (`/users/profile/`)
- `/addresses` manage addresses (`/addresses/`)
- `/orders`, `/orders/[orderId]` list/detail with live status over WebSocket

## Example Data

See `public/example/*.json` for products, categories, orders, and addresses used for offline demos.

## Public Repo & Security

This repository is public so others can view the code and contribute via issues and pull requests. Do not commit real secrets (e.g. Stripe keys, MongoDB URIs, JWT secrets) to the repo—only use placeholder values in example configuration files and keep real credentials in local, untracked `.env` files.

If you have previously pushed real secrets to a public repository, you should rotate those keys (e.g. in Stripe and MongoDB Atlas) and remove the secrets from the git history.
