# Art Bay Frontend Wiki

This wiki provides a central place to discover project docs and context.

## Core Documents

- `README.md` – Setup instructions, commands, and key routes.
- `BACKLOG.md` – Detailed backlog of tasks, priorities, and milestones.
- `timeline.md` – High-level phases and schedule for MVP, Beta, GA, and beyond.
- `roadmap.md` – Feature roadmap organized by “Now / Next / Later”.

## How to Navigate the Work

- Start with `README.md` to get the project running locally.
- Use `timeline.md` to understand where the project is in its lifecycle.
- Use `roadmap.md` to see which feature areas are being emphasized next.
- Use `BACKLOG.md` when you need concrete, actionable tickets to work on.

## Conventions and Milestones

- Priorities: `P0` (must-have), `P1` (high), `P2` (medium), `P3` (nice-to-have).
- Milestones: `[MVP]`, `[Beta]`, `[GA]` as used throughout `BACKLOG.md`.
- Status tags: `[Todo]`, `[In Progress]`, `[Blocked]`, `[Done]`.

These conventions live in `BACKLOG.md` and should be followed for new backlog items to keep everything consistent.
